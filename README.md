# Sudoku / MIT

Sudoku / MIT takes a contraints approach and doesn't guess. Can all Sudokus be solved by constraints? Currently it can generate and solve difficult puzzles, but not the evil ones. Letter Sudokus are possible.

Work needs to be done to generate a valid Sudoku.

It is an open source UI for sudoku, with notes which are updated with every found digit, animations when a set gets full, sounds and keyboard input and looks the same across various display formats. 
It is inspired by soving Sudokus with pen and paper: the player can make errors as all moves are only validated by the most simple constraints.

It is hosted on github pages:
